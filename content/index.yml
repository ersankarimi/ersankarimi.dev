  title: Frequently Asked Questions
  description: Quick answers about how I work and what you can expect.
  categories:
    - title: Services & Process
      questions:
        - label: What services do you offer?
          content: |
            I help teams and clients build and improve web experiences—landing pages, marketing sites, and web app interfaces. I can work end-to-end (plan → build → QA) or support an existing team.
        - label: What is your process like?
          content: |
            I start by aligning on goals and scope, then break work into clear milestones. I share progress early, iterate quickly from feedback, and focus on shipping a polished, reliable result.
        - label: What kind of projects do you usually work on?
          content: |
            Mostly dashboards, admin tools, and marketing websites—turning requirements into clean, responsive screens that feel consistent and easy to use.
        - label: Do you work with startups or small teams?
          content: |
            Yes. I'm comfortable working with lean teams and fast-moving environments, especially when ownership and clear communication matter.
        - label: Can you work with an existing design or codebase?
          content: |
            Definitely. I can implement from Figma, improve an existing UI, refactor for maintainability, or help stabilize and polish a product before release.
        - label: Do you handle both design and development?
          content: |
            I focus on front-end development. If you already have a design (Figma), I can implement it precisely. If not, I can help keep the UI direction simple and clean, and collaborate with a designer when needed.
        - label: Can you share demos of your past work?
          content: |
            Some projects aren't publicly accessible, but I can still explain what I built, the problems I solved, and how I approached them during a call or interview.

    - title: Tech & Quality
      questions:
        - label: What technologies do you usually use?
          content: |
            I'm comfortable with modern front-end workflows—TypeScript, component-driven UI, and utility-first styling. I also adapt quickly to existing stacks depending on the project.
        - label: Can you improve performance and polish an existing UI?
          content: |
            Yes. I can help with UI cleanup, responsive fixes, component refactors, and performance improvements—especially on pages that feel slow or inconsistent.
        - label: Do you use component libraries?
          content: |
            Yes when it makes sense. I like practical UI building blocks, while keeping the look consistent with your product and brand.

    - title: Pricing & Timelines
      questions:
        - label: How much does a project typically cost?
          content: |
            It depends on scope, complexity, and timeline. After a short brief, I'll share a clear estimate with deliverables and milestones.
        - label: What are your payment terms?
          content: |
            For fixed-scope projects, I usually use milestone-based payments. For ongoing work, monthly billing is available.
        - label: How long does a typical project take?
          content: |
            Small tasks can take a few days. A landing page often takes 1–2 weeks, while larger UI work may take several weeks depending on scope and feedback cycles.
        - label: Do you offer ongoing support?
          content: |
            Yes. I can provide ongoing maintenance, UI improvements, and feature support on a part-time basis or monthly retainer.

    - title: Collaboration
      questions:
        - label: What do you need from me to start?
          content: |
            A short brief: goals, target users, references, required pages/features, and any existing design/brand assets. If you have none, we can keep it simple and define them together.
        - label: How do you communicate and share progress?
          content: |
            I share updates regularly via chat and short check-ins, and I keep tasks tracked so priorities and status are always clear.
        - label: What makes your work style different?
          content: |
            I care about the details users feel—clarity, consistency, and speed. I aim to ship clean UI that's easy to maintain and ready for real-world use.
        - label: Are you open to remote work?
          content: |
            Yes. I'm open to remote roles and flexible collaboration setups.
