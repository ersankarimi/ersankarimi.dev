  Hi, I'm **Ersan Karimi** — a Front-End Developer based in **Balikpapan, Indonesia**.&nbsp;

  I have **~3 years of professional experience**, working across in-house teams and freelance projects. I enjoy building web experiences that feel **fast, clear, and polished**, with UI that's easy to use and easy to maintain.&nbsp;

  In my day-to-day work, I've contributed across the full development lifecycle—shipping features from design implementation to deployment, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and continuously improving performance and user experience.

  ### What I'm Building
  I'm currently building **Anggun Praya**, a digital wedding invitation product for Indonesian couples. I take care of it end-to-end—shaping the experience, building the website and templates, collaborating with designers/developers when needed, and making sure everything stays consistent and easy to use.

  ### How I Work
  I like clear milestones, quick feedback loops, and practical solutions. Whether it's a new build or an existing codebase, I focus on details users feel—responsiveness, UI states, consistency, and performance.

  ### Tools I Often Use
  I'm comfortable working with modern Front-End stacks and workflows—TypeScript, clean component architecture, Tailwind-style utility UI, Git-based collaboration, and REST API integrations.

  ### Content & Side Projects
  I also share what I learn on YouTube:

  For fun, I keep a small project to track my workout program:

  ### Beyond Work
  Outside of coding, I enjoy **sports** (basketball, football/soccer, gym/strength training, and running), **fishing**, and **reading**.

  ### Looking For
  I'm currently looking for **Front-End roles**, and I'm also open to freelance collaborations when it's a good fit.&nbsp;

  The best way to reach me is via **email** or **LinkedIn**.
